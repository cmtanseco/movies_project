<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>I will be using Faker, to generate my data for each table. The three main tables will be Movies, Actors, and Directors. A movie can have on director but a director can direct one or more movies. A Movie can have one or many actors and an Actor can be a part of one or many movies. Since there is a many to many relationship, there will be a table to associate the Movies model, with the Actors model.</p>
